Wordle Solver

This program will find the answer to the wordle game. Using Selenium, it inputs guesses into Wordle and interprets the result. Based on information from previous guess results, it chooses the next guess until it finds the anwer or runs out of guesses. It chooses words from those in the file words.txt.

To run, download the appropiate chromedriver and place it in the root of project, then use command:
